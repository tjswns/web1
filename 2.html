<h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>This document defines Decentralized identifiers (DIDs),<br>
a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.<br>
A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model<br>
, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.<br>
In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that<br>
hey may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers,<br>
and certificate authorities. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject<br>
with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.<br>
Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services,<br>
which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID<br>
Please read our Press Release to learn more about this tool to empower everyone on the web with<br>
privacy-respecting online identity and consent-based data sharing.<br>
